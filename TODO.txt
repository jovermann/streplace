Options of streplace 0.9: (only a subset of these will be implemented)

or:    streplace [OPTIONS and RULES] -       (read from stdin/write to stdout)

file options:
-r --recursive        recurse directories
-l --follow-links     follow symbolic links
-o --only=LIST        process only files with extension in comma separated LIST
                      (multiple allowed)
-H --html-only        same as -o "html,htm,shtml,dhtml"
-C --c-only           same as -o "c,cc,C,cxx,cpp,h,hh,H,hxx,hpp,i,inc,m,mm,M"
-E --ignore-errors    skip files/directories that cant be read/written/renamed

matching options:

-I --preserve-case    try to preserve case in replacements
   --lower-case       lower replacements
   --upper-case       upper replacements
   --capitalize-case  capitalize replacements
-n --match-newline    match any character operators also match newline char
   --select-lines=R   split file into lines and replace only in lines matching
                      regex R
   --ignore-lines=R   split file into lines and replace only in lines not
                      matching matching regex R
   --const-length     make sure that the left and the right side of each rule
                      have the same length (only if -x, useful with binary
                      files)
   --try-all-pos      write N files nnn_hexpos_FILE if there are N locations
                      for a pattern (only if -x\, useful for patching binaries)

backup options:
-b --backup           make backup before a file is modified if no backup exists
-S --suffix=SUF       set the backup suffix to SUF (default=".~sub~")
   --restore          restore all files from their backups (==> undo all
                      changes), specify the files to be restored

renaming options: (restore cant unrename)
-A --rename           rules work also on names: rename files and directories
-N --rename-only      same as --rename, but do not modify files contents
   --across-dirs      for -A and -N: rules work on the whole path possibly
                      moving the file across directories up and down the
                      hierachy (i.e. slash is a normal character which can be
                      replaced by anything, the resulting path is the new
                      filename)
-f --force            replace existing files during rename, use with caution
-s --modify-symlinks  rules work only on the contents of symlinks (not their
                      name), all other files and their contents are ignored
-t --shorten=N        for -N and -A: shorten filenames to a maximum of N
                      characters while keeping the extension by using certain
                      heuristics after replacing (range=[0..])
   --sane-filename    strip all kinds of illegal chars from filenames but allow
                      spaces (useful with -N)
   --sane-filename2   strip all kinds of illegal chars from filenames including
                      spaces (useful with -N)
-R --resolve-clash    resolve nameclashes by prepending N_ before the new
                      filename where N makes the filename unique
   --norm-ext-dos     normalize certain extensions like jpeg -> jpg, mpeg ->
                      mpg to 3 characters
   --norm-ext         normalize certain extensions like jpg -> jpeg, MPEG3 ->
                      mp3 with canonical length
   --assume-cifs      assume case-insensitive filesystem (default on Apple
                      systems)
   --assume-csfs      assume case-sensitive filesystem (default on non-Apple
                      systems)

special options:
   --ignfilepat=P     ignore files in which pattern P is found (multiple
                      allowed)
   --ignfilepat-nore  match ignore pattern as a simple string, not as a regexp
-M --max-filesize=N   skip files which are larger than N megabytes (default 0 =
                      unlimited) (range=[0..])
-U --dos-to-unix      convert all files which *only* contain DOS line
                      termination to unix line termination, works also on
                      binary files and is very robust
-u --dos-to-unix2     convert all DOS line termination to unix line termination
                      (for files which partly contain DOS line termination)

color configuration:
   --color-bold=SEQ   escape sequence used to switch terminal to bold mode
                      (default="\33[01m")
   --color-thin=SEQ   escape sequence used to switch terminal to thin mode
                      (default="\33[07m")
   --color-nor=SEQ    escape sequence used to switch terminal back to normal
                      mode (default="\33[00m")
-Q --no-color         do *not* colorize output with ansi sequences
   --bold             do not use colors, but use bold and reverse to hilite
                      text
   --bcolor           use colors which are useful on a bright terminal
                      background
   --dcolor           use colors which are useful on a dark terminal background
   --save-colors      save colors to config file ~/.streplacerc

common options:
-q --quiet            quiet execution
-P --progress=NUM     progress indicator, useful with large files, print a '.'
                      per NUM replacements (range=[0..])
-h --help             print this help message, then exit successfully (only
                      command line)
   --version          print version, then exit successfully (only command line)

config file options:
   --verbose-config   print all options, values and where they were specified,
                      then exit (only command line)
   --rc-file=FILE     use FILE as rcfile (only command line)
   --create-rc=FILE   create a FILE with default values for all options (only
                      command line)
